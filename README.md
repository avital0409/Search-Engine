# Search Engine Interface

This project is a web-based interface inspired by the Google search engine. The interface includes a search page and a search results page, both visually similar to Google's design.

## Project Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- Implement a web interface inspired by Google.
- The interface should include a search page and a search results page.
- Both pages must contain all visual elements (menus, buttons, search box, list of search results, etc.).
- All displayed information is static. The search results shown on the results page are fixed and do not change; they will be the same on every page load.
- Only visual elements should be implemented; no server-side or JavaScript functionality is required.
- The implementation should be done using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### Design and Quality Enhancements
- The design should be reasonably similar to Google's, but it does not have to be identical.
- A good or close-to-original design is required for a higher grade.
- No additional technologies or libraries are allowed beyond the specified ones.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main search page.
- `searchResult.html`: The search results page.
- `styles/`: Folder containing custom CSS styles.
- `images/`: Folder for images used in the project.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
